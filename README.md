# User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
-GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
-WHEN I load their portfolio
-THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
-WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
-THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
-WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
-THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
-WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
-THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
-WHEN I click on the images of the applications
-THEN I am taken to that deployed application
-WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
-THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
